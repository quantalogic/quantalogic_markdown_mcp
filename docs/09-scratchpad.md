# Scratchpad for Implementation

## Current Understanding

Starting implementation of stateless architecture for QuantaLogic Markdown MCP server.

## Key Points to Remember

1. Need to maintain backward compatibility
2. Add document_path as first parameter to all tools
3. Transform from stateful to stateless architecture
4. Comprehensive testing is critical

## Current Status - Phase 1 Complete

- âœ… Created StatelessMarkdownProcessor - working perfectly
- âœ… Created test utilities
- âœ… Basic Enhanced MCP server structure

## Implementation Issue Found

The EnhancedMarkdownMCPServer approach needs refinement. The FastMCP decorator approach conflicts with inheritance. The tools are being registered but not accessible as instance methods.

## Solution Approach - UPDATED

User confirmed: No need to support old API! 

New approach:
1. âœ… Keep StatelessMarkdownProcessor (already created and tested)
2. ðŸ”„ Modify existing MarkdownMCPServer directly to use stateless operations
3. ðŸ”„ Update all tools to require document_path as first parameter
4. ðŸ”„ Remove all stateful operations from the server
5. ðŸ”„ Update all tests to use new API

## Notes

Will track detailed implementation notes here as I work through each phase.
