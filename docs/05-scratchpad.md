# SafeMarkdownEditor Implementation Scratchpad

This document contains my thoughts and notes while implementing the SafeMarkdownEditor API specification.

## Initial Analysis

Looking at the current codebase, I can see:

1. **Existing Infrastructure**: We have a solid foundation with QuantalogicMarkdownParser, AST utilities, and rendering capabilities
2. **Examples**: There's already a SafeMarkdownEditor example in the examples/ directory, but it's not the actual implementation
3. **Current Types**: We have basic ParseResult, ParseError, and ErrorLevel already implemented

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Start Small, Build Incrementally
I'll implement the core data types first, then build the SafeMarkdownEditor class piece by piece. The key is to ensure each piece is thoroughly tested before moving to the next.

### Phase 2: Atomic Operations Focus
Every operation must be atomic - either it succeeds completely or fails completely with no side effects. This means I need to implement a rollback mechanism early on.

### Phase 3: Thread Safety
The specification requires thread safety. I'll need to implement proper locking mechanisms from the start, not as an afterthought.

## Current Thoughts

### Section Identification Strategy
The specification uses hash-based IDs for stable section references. This is much better than the string-based approach in the example. I need to implement a robust hashing strategy that remains stable across content changes but updates when structural changes occur.

### Validation Levels
The three-tier validation system (STRICT, NORMAL, PERMISSIVE) is a good design. I'll implement NORMAL as the default and ensure it provides a good balance between safety and usability.

### Error Handling Philosophy
Rich error reporting with suggestions is crucial. Users should never be left wondering what went wrong or how to fix it.

## Implementation Notes

### Dependencies
- Need to check what additional dependencies might be required
- Threading support for concurrent access
- Consider using dataclasses for immutable objects

### Architecture Decision
I'll create the SafeMarkdownEditor as a new module in src/quantalogic_markdown_mcp/ rather than modifying existing files. This keeps the implementation clean and separate.

### Testing Strategy
Each method will have corresponding unit tests. I'll also create integration tests that test multiple operations together to ensure atomicity works correctly.

## Next Steps

1. Implement core data types
2. Create basic SafeMarkdownEditor class structure
3. Implement document inspection methods first (they're the safest to start with)
4. Add transaction and rollback support
5. Implement editing operations with full validation

## Questions/Considerations

- Should I use asyncio for thread safety or traditional threading?
- How to handle very large documents efficiently?
- What's the best way to implement preview functionality?
- How to ensure backward compatibility with existing code?

## Progress Notes

### ✅ Phase 1 Complete: Core Data Types
- Successfully implemented all core data types
- SectionReference with stable hash-based IDs works well
- EditResult provides comprehensive feedback
- ValidationLevel enum offers good flexibility

### ✅ Phase 2 Mostly Complete: SafeMarkdownEditor Core
- Basic class structure with thread safety implemented
- Constructor with validation works correctly
- Transaction framework in place (basic version)

### ✅ Phase 3 Complete: Document Inspection
- All document inspection methods working
- get_sections() builds stable references correctly
- Section hierarchy detection works well
- get_child_sections() logic implemented

### ✅ Phase 4 Partially Complete: Preview Operations
- preview_operation() implemented for UPDATE_SECTION and INSERT_SECTION
- Need to add support for more operation types
- Preview validation working correctly

### ✅ Phase 5 Partially Complete: Section Operations  
- update_section_content() implemented and tested
- Transaction support working
- Need to implement remaining section operations

### Current Status
- Basic functionality tested and working
- Thread safety implemented via RLock
- Preview system working for basic operations
- Transaction system in place

### Next Priority Items
1. Implement remaining section operations (insert, delete, move)
2. Add more operation types to preview
3. Implement batch operations
4. Add comprehensive validation methods
5. Implement transaction rollback functionality

### Issues Found
- Line number calculation seems accurate based on test results
- Section boundary detection working correctly
- Need to improve section content detection for preserve_subsections

### Architecture Decisions Made
- Using RLock for thread safety (allows recursive locking)
- Stable section IDs based on content hash + position
- Transaction log stores complete document state (simple but memory-intensive)
- Preview operations create temporary state without modifying original
