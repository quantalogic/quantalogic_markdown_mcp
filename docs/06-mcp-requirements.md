We want to expose the SafeMarkdownEditor as a Model Control Protocol (MCP) API, allowing users to interact with Markdown documents in a safe and structured way by a generative AI model.

We need to study the best way to implement the MCP API, ensuring it meets the requirements of the SafeMarkdownEditor while providing a clear and efficient interface for users.

We need to find the best practices for implementing an MCP API, including:

- Defining the API endpoints and their expected behaviors
- Choose the right library for handling MCP requests and responses
- Implementing error handling and validation
